# hello-world
Hello world! I am Calley... I have had a github account for a while now (I honestly can't remember why I created this account); however, I have never used this option and can't wait to see what this entails and how much fun I can have while I am here.
Just to add more information, I am studying IT Website Programming in hopes of becoming a successful webdev someday. I am a firm believer that we can do anything we put our mind into doing.
